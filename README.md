# Hashketball

## Instructions

Great news! You're going to an NBA game! The only catch is that you've been volunteered to keep stats at the game.

There is a nested hash in `game_hash.rb` that defines a game, with two teams, their players, and the players stats.

Using the power of Ruby, and the game hash in `game_hash.rb`, write methods to complete the following:

1. Return the name of the home team and the away team. We've helped you get started on this.

2. Return a team's colors.

3. Print out the points scored by each player on a team.

4. Return all the stats for a player, given a player's team and name. Hint: The .find method will be helpful (it works a little like .each).

5. Return a player's shoe size. Hint: try finding the player first (the same way you did with `player_stats`) then look for his shoe size.

6. Return the number of rebounds for the player with the largest shoe size.

7. Return a player's number of slam dunks given only the player's name (no team name).

**Bonus Questions:**

Define methods to return the answer to the following questions:

1. Which player has the most points? Call the method `most_points_scored`.

2. Which team has the most points? Call the method `winning_team`.

3. Which player has the longest name? Call the method `player_with_longest_name`.

**Super Bonus:**

1. Write a method that returns true if the player with the longest name had the most steals. Call the method `long_name_steals_a_ton?`.
